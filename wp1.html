<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >The bargaining problem is often given as follows <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XR82">Rub82</a>,&#x00A0;pg 97]</span>:
       <!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >    Two individuals have before them several possible contractual
       agreements. Both have interests in reaching agreement but their
       interests  are  not  entirely  identical.  What  &#8220;will  be&#8221;  the  agreed
       contract, assuming that both parties behave rationally?
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >This is age-old question has long frustrated game theorists. Without ways to enforce
binding threats, negotiation can be unpredictable, and often the outcome is determined
by difficult to quantify &#8220;negotiation skills&#8221;. Solutions to hard problems are by nature
evasive, so academics usually restrict themselves to tractable models. In 1953, Nash
<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNash53">Nas53</a>]</span> studied a model demand game, and gave axiomatic characterizations of the so
called Nash Bargaining Solution. Rubinstein&#8217;s seminal paper <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XR82">Rub82</a>]</span> in 1982 indicated
a possible strategic approach towards inducing a solution. Rubinstein&#8217;s game (developed
further in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBRW86">BRW86</a>]</span>) introduced two factors forcing the players to resolve the game: 1) A
penalty for time spent negotiating and 2) exogenous probability of negotiation
breakdown.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >  Game theoretical situations, in contrast to real world negotiations, usually allow
players to choose from a finite-parameter space of moves. In the real world, there are an
unlimited number of moves, and there are an unlimited number of games players can

choose to play. In fact, if resolving a situation by playing a game is preferable to not
doing so, the first leveraged negotiation should be over which game, out of a set of many
possible games, is to be played. If players are bound to the rules of a game, tidy solutions
may be found. But no player would agree to play a game whose rules put him at a
disadvantage.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  Using blockchain technologies, we would like to offer a player tools from game theory.
In particular, the player should be able to make the strongest move possible: A move
that commits the player to some action in a way that gives limited rational options for
the adversary, while minimizing the probability of a disastrous outcome. The best way to
accomplish this objective is to use mixed strategies and smart contracts. We
hope this will be used to induce solutions that are economically and socially
optimal.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  Often times in the more serious situations, negotiation is handled by expensive
lawyers, or for other reasons, is costly or inefficient. Wars of attrition are inefficient and
often lead to an unfair bargain. By setting up a platform, we would like to allow for parts
of the negotiation process to move more efficiently, with ready-to-go &#8220;moves&#8221; that allow
a traditionally disadvantaged party to use leverage against larger adversaries, whenever
the economics of the situation dictates.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >  We refer the reader to T.C. Schelling&#8217;s classic text, <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>]</span> for a fascinating
discussion of how game theory meets the real world. A more modern reference on the
theoretical side is given in the monograph <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XMuthoo">Mut99</a>]</span>, which includes a thorough
discussion of Rubinstein type games.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Levetrage</h3>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >When two parties are negotiating over a surplus, there is a well-defined idea in game
theory literature of what the agreement &#8220;should&#8221; be. This is called the Nash Bargaining
Solution (NBS). Assuming that the NBS is the result of an efficient market, any
agreement reached other than the NBS should be considered a market inefficiency. A
market inefficiency is an arbitrage opportunity. In this case, the intermediate currency
used is leverage.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  So how does one use leverage to arbitrage in this situation? In many situations,
achieving fair market outcome requires changing the nature of the negotiation game from
an Ultimatum game (see Example <a 
href="#x1-8001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: UG --></a>, below) to a probabilistic Rubinstein type game (see
Example <a 
href="#x1-8003r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: RG --></a>, below ). With access to smart contracts that execute mixed strategies, this
becomes possible through our platform.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >  To be clear, we don&#8217;t intend to by and sell leverage directly, rather, our goal is to give
parties the tools to speed the efficient agreement.
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-40003.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Levetrage as a Platform.</span></span>
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >  The Levetrage Platform will consist of a set of tools that can be readily accessed by an
agent wanting to improve their bargaining position and expedite the bargaining process.
To begin, <span 
class="cmbx-10">we provide options for making binding threats and commitments</span>.
This will require an interface between the blockchain and the real world, but this
interface will be much cleaner than traditional (non-smart) contracts. Next,
<span 
class="cmbx-10">we provide a way to implement verifiable mixed strategies: namely,</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">making binding probabilistic threats. </span>This feature will allow one party to
minimize his exposure to an acceptable level while increasing the exposure
of the adversary to a sufficiently unpleasant level. Along these lines, we offer

tools to enact irrevocable maneuvers that result in negative consequences for
both parties, in a way that must be taken seriously. We suggest some specific
maneuvers.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-50003.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Levetrage as a Service.</span></span>
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >  Necessarily, the interface will be more complicated than an app. A typical user lacking
blockchain savvy should be able to hire a professional at fairly inexpensive rate
(compared with say, a lawyer), who would quickly interface with our platform to devise a
working strategy that maximizes the end user&#8217;s interests. Examples of irrevocable actions
include efforts by law firms, public relations or advertising firms. In the final picture, the
Levetrage ecosystem will be a reputation based network of oracles, lawyers,
actuaries, blockchain engineers, public relations firms and IoT nodes such as
billboards.
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-60003.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Nash tokens.</span></span>
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >  The platform will be monetized by use of Nash tokens. Nash token holders will receive
the proceeds when certain contracts fail. Nash tokens will be burnt in order to perform
&#8220;moves&#8221;. There will be a fixed number of tokens, however, the cost (in tokens) for certain
moves will be controlled externally, to compensate for possible deflation. ETH will
remain the underlying currency.

<span 
class="cmti-10">the energy and money to fight this.</span>
  </div>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >What&#8217;s common in the above three examples is that one party is leveraging the other
party&#8217;s rational self-interest. Exploiting the fact that each player has a relatively
limited set of moves, <span 
class="cmmi-10">X </span>has manipulated the game to a point where the other
player&#8217;s best strategy is determined. This is called <span 
class="cmti-10">subgame perfection </span>in game
theory.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >  The problem we would like address can be summarized as &#8220;inefficiencies in adversarial
bargaining&#8221;. We assert that if one agent is allowed to cheat, there is inefficiency. Such
situations occur frequently in the fabric of our legal and economic systems. If a party
with deep pockets squares off in legal dispute with a smaller party, the common
assumption is that the advantage is with the larger party: The smaller party is
often better advised to avoid a lengthy and expensive legal battle, even if it is a
battle that they would most likely win. When a pyrrhic victory is compared
with slightly unfair settlement, a rational individual may choose the unfair
settlement. The ability of a party to arrive at unfair agreements terms distorts the
free market and undercuts its effectiveness. An economically optimal solution
should allow both parties equal opportunity to leverage the potential costs to the
adversary.

<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >What should the fair arrangement be? Egalitarian principles dictate that the surplus
should be shared, and a belief in free market competition suggests this too: unless one
party has demonstrated it is better suited to control a resource, sharing a divisible
resource promotes competition. The Nash bargaining solution <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

the surplus should be split down the middle when the players are on equal
footing.

 id="x1-100006.1"></a><span

<!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >  Nash <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNash53">Nas53</a>]</span> studied the problem of bargaining using an axiomatic approach, and
characterized equilibria. Given a set of axioms (which are probably not realistic) Nash
determined that the best solution was to find the value <span 
class="cmmi-10">x </span>that maximizes the
function

where <span

class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> and <span 
class="cmmi-10">u</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> are the utilities enjoyed from a particular agreement by Players 1 and 2,
respectively, over a set of possible agreements <span 
class="cmmi-10">x </span><span

class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> and <span 
class="cmmi-10">d</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> are the utilities
gained if the negotiation fails. For example, in the ultimatum game, Example <a 
href="#x1-8001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: UG --></a>,
the disagreement point <span 
class="cmmi-10">d </span>= (<span 
class="cmmi-10">d</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">1</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10">,d</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>) is (0<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>0): That is, if they disagree, each
player gets nothing. Nash&#8217;s axioms included symmetry: Except for the very
important question of who offers first, Example <a 
href="#x1-8001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: UG --></a> is symmetric between the two
players.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >  Nash&#8217;s axioms also included translation invariance. The solution should not depend on
where the disagreement points lies on the plane, but where it lies with respect to the
other possible agreement points. For example, if both players are charged $50,000 to play
the game (making it zero sum), the negotiations should be the same: Each
player should be equally averse to losing $50,000 as they are keen to gaining
same.

<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >  Note however, that if Player 2 could raise his own disagreement value <span 
class="cmmi-10">d</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>, this would
alter the location where the maximum occurs in (<a 
href="#x1-10001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: NBE --></a>). We propose a way to do this in
section <a 
href="#x1-120007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: commit --></a>.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >  In Example <a 
href="#x1-7001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: Mike --></a>, the idea of fair market value of Mike&#8217;s effort is not so clear, because the
market is not stepping in to narrow the surplus. If a competitor to X were
to move down the street from X, Mike with his unique skill-set could spark a
bidding war, and find his effort is suddenly worth several times more. Even
without a competitor, we can view Mike&#8217;s situation as an either an Ultimatum
Game (Example <a 
href="#x1-8001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: UG --></a>) in the case that X gives Mike a &#8220;take-it-or-leave-it&#8220; offer, or
as a Negotiation Game (Example <a 
href="#x1-8002r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: NG --></a>) in the case that Mike feels empowered
to negotiate. We assume that Mike, with his work ethic and skill-set, could
earn $100,000 at another position in another industry if he left X. So Mike&#8217;s
disagreement value is $100,000, while X&#8217;s disagreement value would be the
maximum of 0 or $1,000,000 minus the cost of finding and training a suitable
replacement for Mike, minus any other losses incurred in the process. If we assume X&#8217;s
disagreement value is 0, then maximizing (<a 
href="#x1-10001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: NBE --></a>) one concludes that Mike could be making
$550,000.
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >  In reality, one would not expect Mike to negotiate such a payraise. In many industries,
employees who want a raise are often best advised to walk into their manager&#8217;s office
with an outside offer. This leads to the inefficient practice of raise-deserving
employees applying for jobs with companies at which they are not interested in
working.
<!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >  In comparison, the disputes in the other two examples appear to be not over a
surplus, but over negative consequences resulting from litigation. However, if we accept
translation invariance of the problem, this is a matter of perspective: In Example <a 
href="#x1-7002r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Jane --></a>, one
can set the disagreement point to be the costs to both parties after a long and expensive
and possibly public lawsuit. To explore this situation further, let&#8217;s assume that both
parties understand that a legal action will most likely end with Jane being
refunded. Both parties also know that it will be easy for lawyers to obfuscate long
enough to make the case significantly painful to prosecute. In this particular
jurisdiction it is likely that the court may only award Jane a portion of legal fees.
So for the sake of making up numbers, Jane can expect to gain the $13,000
difference, but possibly incur $25,000 of legal fees, of which only $10,000 will
may be reimbursed. On the other hand, X will expect pay perhaps $30,000
for legal fees, pay a $13,000 reimbursement, $10,000 in Jane&#8217;s legal fees, and
in addition may lose $50,000 in profits as sales drop due to bad publicity. So
Jane stands to lose $2,000, while X stands to lose $100,000. The disagreement
point is then (<span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span>$2<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span><span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span>$100<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000) and set of possible agreements <span 
class="msbm-10">A </span>should be
the set of partial or complete refunds given to Jane instead of going to trial.
Simple calculus determines that the maximum of (<a 
href="#x1-10001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: NBE --></a>) occurs on the far endpoint:
Jane should get her full refund. Intuitively, this is obvious, the incentives of
coming to a settlement are clearly much more compelling for X than for Jane. If
Jane threatens to sue, and she can be taken credibly, X will immediately make
the payment. The problem is that they have no reason to take such a threat
credibly . They are certain Jane will not sue; as for her, the decision is a net
negative.

<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >  In 1982, by introducing discounting, Rubinstein devised a game that would force the

players to come to a solution early on in the negotiation stages. There a two ways to do
the discounting: Assume that time is costly to both parties, or assume that there is some
probability at each time that the negotiations could fail. In either case, Player 1 should
be able to make an optimal offer that will immediately be accepted by Player 2. In some
versions of the game, the players do not control probability <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>that the game will
continue. If <span 
class="cmmi-10">p &#x003C;&#x003C; </span>1, Player 1 will have higher expectation than Player 2, however,
this probability will be less than 1<span

class="cmmi-10">p</span>,
then Player 1 should choose is as close to 1 as possible, and then offer 1<span

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7. </span> <a

<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >Before delving into probabilistic strategies, we explore the basic maneuver of moving the
disagreement point by creating commitment. We encourage the reader to see that classic
textbook by Schelling for a more verbose and interesting discussion of the various topics
discussed here. Paraphrasing Schelling&#8217;s definition of commitment: <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>]</span>[pg 127], we
say that commitment involves maneuvers that leave one in a position so that their only
rational option is follow through with a threat. The object of commitment is the
credibility of a threat. We will allow Nash to introduce the issues involving threats
<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNash53">Nas53</a>,&#x00A0;pg 130]</span>:
       <!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >    If one considers the process of making a threat, one sees that
       its elements are as follows: A threatens B by convincing B that if
       B does not act in compliance with A&#8217;s demands, the A will follow
       a certain policy T. Suppose A and B to be rational beings, it is
       essential for the success of the threat that A be <span 
class="cmti-10">compelled </span>to carry

       out his threat T if B fails to comply. Otherwise it will have little
       meaning. For, in general, to execute the threat will not be something
       A would want to do, just of itself. The point of this discussion is
       that we must assume there is an adequate mechanism for forcing
       players to stick to their threats and demands once made: and one
       to enforce the bargain, once agreed. Thus we need a sort of umpire,
       who will enforce contracts of commitments.
<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >  What Jane needs in Example <a 
href="#x1-7002r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: Jane --></a> is the ability to make binding threats. We propose one
here. Jane takes $10,000 in ETH, deposits it to an address and creates the following
contract. In 30 days, the contract will read a channel that by default is broadcasting
&#8217;Unfulfilled&#8217;. If after 30 days, the channel is broadcasting &#8217;Fulfilled&#8217;, Jane gets her
money back. If not, the ETH will be distributed to holders of Nash coins, lost to
Jane forever. The channel is controlled by a well-reputed oracle who Jane has
commissioned to toggle the channel only in the condition Jane presents the oracle with
either a $13,000 check from X, or, a court copy of a civil action filed against
X.
<!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >  Now, the tables have turned. Jane contacts X, and tells them that she is not merely
threatening a lawsuit, but that it is now against her interest to fail to file the lawsuit.
She explains to X how it works, and hands them a copy of the arrangement she has made
with the oracle. At this point, X is wise to assume that Jane is not bluffing. If X is
rational X will pay her immediately.
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >  The game is not completely set, however, as there are other moves that X may be able
to make. For example, if they are also blockchain savvy, they may be able to create
imaginative responses. Such a response may bind them to not pay, unless $5000 is
deposited into an address. If they are able to communicate this to Jane, they have
created a way out for Jane, which rationally, she should accept. She could respond
with a counter-commitment, and this could go on. The best way for Jane to
preclude counter offers is to go off the grid, and leave the oracle to collect the
check.

<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >  Implementing a legal contract accomplishing the above would be more problematic.
Technically, the code that receives a broadcast signal and either refunds or distributes
Jane&#8217;s money is not a legal contract. It&#8217;s a piece of code. (If there is a &#8220;meeting of the
minds&#8221; it is between Nash token holders and Jane, but we do not argue that here.) So it
doesn&#8217;t require all parties to give considerations. Nor is there a question of jurisdiction,
or enforceability by a court. It simply happens. The arrangement between Jane and the
oracle is quite simple. If Jane were to try and devise the same contract in real life, she
would deposit the money in escrow, but in theory, would be able to sue to get the
money, arguing in a court that the original arrangement did not constitute
an enforceable agreement. The escrow transaction is reversible, and a court
may order this. Her adversary, if well advised, would probably be aware of
this.

 id="x1-140007.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Possible Conflicts of Interest.</span></span>
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >  By default, the oracle does nothing. The oracle has a reputation to uphold, so is
happy to simply key the correct outcome. However, in theory, the oracle could offer to
toggle the channel for a mere $500. This possibility is unfortunately hard to eradicate
completely. We hope that the cost to the oracle of losing their reputation is significant

enough to avoid this possibility. It is worth pointing out that, in order for this to work,
what matters is not the scruples of the oracle, but rather, that X believe the
oracle is scrupulous. X must consider the most likely possibility that the oracle
is scrupulous and cannot count on Jane and the oracle colluding to change
this.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >  Nonetheless, we would prefer an arrangement that doesn&#8217;t offer any room for
dishonesty.

<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >  In the example in this section, Jane has no way out. This is by design. However, if her
adversary is stubborn, vindictive, not thinking clearly or simply unable to wrap their
mind around the concept of a smart contract, Jane may have made a bad decision. Jane
does not know ahead of time the probability that this will happen, however,
she may be able to estimate it. If the probability that X is going to proceed
irrationally is greater than a certain threshold, Jane is wise not to proceed. In
the following section we offer a way to minimize the risk when the adversary
has a possibility of being irrational, while still taking advantage of available
leverage.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8. </span> <a 
 id="x1-160008"></a>Mixed Strategies</h3>
<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >In game theory, a mixed strategy is a strategy that has a random component. For
example, a soccer player making penalty kicks may be a better shot kicking to her left.
However, if she always kicks to her left, the goalkeeper will anticipate this. The shooter
should devise a plan to kick, say 60% of shots to her left: This will not allow the goalie to
anticipate the shot, but still allows her to use her better shot more often than not. The
idea goes back to Von Neumann in 1928 <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNeumann1928">Neu28</a>]</span>, in his proof of a famous theorem
stating that all <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>player games enjoy Nash equilibria, provided that players are allowed
mixed strategies. Intuitively, by asserting a small probability of a move that will be
damaging to the opponent, one can change the opponents strategy entirely, even without
committing to the move. By using all probabilities in between 0 and 1, one can solve an
optimization problem - maximizing the opponents exposure while minimizing one&#8217;s
own.
<!--l. 175--><p class="indent" >  We begin with a slight mix of game theory and its interactions with the real world.
Suppose that Players 1 and 2 are playing the Negotiation Game (Example <a 
href="#x1-8002r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: NG --></a>), but Player
1 is impatient. Player 1 decides to makes an offer to split the pot down the middle, and
then adds that if the offer is not accepted Player 1 will terminate the game
and walk away. This threat becomes useful only if Player 2 receives the threat,
believes the threat, and is willing to act rationally upon it. However, Player 1 is
not 100% confident that Player 2 will respond: The threat may not have been
received credibly, or was not received at all. So there is risk to Player 1 that the
strategy will backfire. Player 1 wants to minimize the risk of walking away with
nothing.
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-170008.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Jane&#8217;s example, again.</span></span>
<!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >  Jane would like a way to create a commitment that will hold with some probability.
She devises the following. Again, she takes $10,000 and deposits it to an address. She sets
a broadcast to &#8220;tick-tock.&#8221; Each day the contract checks the broadcast. If the channel is
broadcasting &#8220;tick-tock&#8220; the contract chooses a random number between 1 and 100. If
that number is larger than 95, the contract takes the money and deposits it as a

non-refundable retainer in an account held by law firm Y. Jane has signed a retainer
agreement with Law firm Y. Their agreement is that, as soon as they receive a
payment from Jane, they immediately begin filing a civil action against X and
will deliver 40 hours of billed work for Jane on this case. Jane presents this
arrangement to X. Assuming that commencing the lawsuit will result in losses to
both parties as described above, each day, the expected cost to Jane should be
0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>05 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7;-</span>$2<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000 = <span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span>$100. This is not a dear price to pay to show X that she
is serious. Meanwhile the expected cost to X from this arrangement will be
0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>05 <span 
class="cmsy-10">&#x00D7;-</span>$100<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000 = <span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span>$5<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000. This is much more significant, and should be taken
seriously. Jane can leave this event to chance for several days or weeks - until she
determines that there is no further value in doing this. Of course, in the process she may
end up filing a lawsuit. But she can bound the probability of this event from
above.
<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >  In comparison, consider the following hypothetical discussed by Schelling <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>,&#x00A0;pg
196]</span>: A hitchhiker pulls a gun on a driver. The driver responds that he will crash the
vehicle, killing both, unless the hitchhiker tosses the gun out the window. The
hitchhiker finds this threat irrational and continues to make demands on the
driver. So the driver begins to accelerate. At 120 miles per hour, the hitchhiker
must realize that the probability of a fatal accident is now very much a positive
number.
<!--l. 187--><p class="indent" >  The hitchhiker situation is similar in some aspects, but economically much
different. Indeed, both the hitchhiker and the driver stand to lose their lives. The
driver (who may have a respectable job, and a family) likely has more to lose
than a hitchhiker who is robbing kind strangers. If the hitchhiker realizes this,
the hitchhiker is smart to keep the weapon cocked. The driver is making an
irrational decision to drive recklessly and will eventually slow the car. On the
other hand, Jane has much less to lose. The company X, which is (in theory)
motivated my money, will not be interested in playing this game for long. This the
major element that she is leveraging, and why her strategy should work if X is
rational.
<!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >  However, Schelling&#8217;s point is summarized &#8220;the only way to becoming physically
committed to an action is to initiate it&#8221;. When Jane posts and allows a contract to be
executed, she is doing precisely that.
<!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >  Schelling describes mixed strategies as a tool &#8220;scale down&#8221; the threat <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>,&#x00A0;pg
178-179]</span>. This accounts for the possibility that a threat may be ignored: The threat was
not communicated, the threat was miscommunicated, or the adversary may have a
nature which ignores the threat (i.e. the scorpion who stings the frog, ushering in his own
watery death), the adversary is playing a &#8220;long game&#8221; and is trying to create an illusion
of irrationality, or other unforeseen reasons. In fact, if one has a reasonable guess at the
probability that a threat will fails for unknown reasons, and also has a guess at how high
of probability needs to be to form an effective threat, one can compute a range
of probabilities that will be useful. Using the calculus in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>,&#x00A0;pg. 180]</span> it
may be that the only threats worth making involve probabilities in a small
interval.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9. </span> <a 
 id="x1-180009"></a>The Hornet&#8217;s Nest Piñata</h3>
<!--l. 195--><p class="noindent" >Often in litigation, the party with the smaller bankroll will be advised not to &#8221;kick the
hornet&#8217;s nest.&#8220; Lawyers tell clients that the adversary is exceeding mean and will &#8220;scorch
the earth&#8220; when they become angered. For this reason, litigants are often told not to

speak to the press or anyone about a particular case, in order to maintain the possibility
of a merely mildly uncomfortable settlement. This essentially allows the manipulative
party to keep their thumb on the smaller party while grinding out a campaign of
attrition.
<!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >  Companies and individuals are very reluctant to engage a public opinion battle.
Lawyers are typically not social media savvy, and would like to keep the fight in their
own domain. Thus the adversary can often rely on lawyers to counsel their clients to keep
the dispute within the legal system where the lawyers have control. On the other hand, a
battle fought in the press or over social media is unpredictable and can be devastating.
For this reason, going public can be the ultimate act of kicking the hornet&#8217;s
nest. This is a clear threat that an individual facing down a bully can make.
However, going to the press is irrevocable so the bully can often rest assured: The
weaker party knows the consequences of crossing the line and will never do
it.
<!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >  This is where the option of a mixed strategy is most attractive: A litigant can commit
to crossing this line, without actually crossing it.
<!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >  Consider Example <a 
href="#x1-7003r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: Joe --></a>. Frustrated at being silenced, Joe is tempted to tell his story even
louder, but his attorney tells Joe : Pay up and move on, don&#8217;t kick the hornet&#8217;s nest. We
would like offer Joe an option. Joe collects the documents, a list of corroborating
witnesses, his own juicy account of the story, and a copy of the SLAPP complaint. Joe
places this all in an envelope and contacts a public relations firm A. Joe signs an
agreement with A: &#8220;If I deposit $5000 in your account, you are to spend $5000
publicizing this story. If I do not deposit $5000 within two months, destroy the
envelope.&#8220; Then Joe sets up a smart contract similar to Jane&#8217;s, a probability of 5% per
day of triggering the event. If the wrong number comes up, the hornet&#8217;s nest is
irrevocably blown apart. If the lawyers are to be believed, both sides are in for a long
and ugly battle, yet a battle that Joe will eventually win and cause heavy losses to
X.
<!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >  We feel that this is the key use case of Levetrage. Going to the press, or even further,
hiring a PR firm, is a very damaging escalation, and as such can be one of the most
powerful threats. Notice that this can be applied in either of the other two
examples: Paying a PR firm to blast the company will cost Jane, but will hurt X
much worse, even if neither party involves a court. So instead of a lawsuit,
Jane could simply threaten to launch a $2500 publicity campaign against the
company with probability <span 
class="cmmi-10">p. </span>In Mike&#8217;s case, publicly badmouthing his employer
would certainly cause them to part ways and cause them both great damage.
(Of course, Mike might want to consider how this would appear to any future
employer.)
<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >  In practice, there are a number of ways to spread damaging information.
Renting a billboard is now easy. SEO firms can blanket the internet with social
media posts. It is also worth suggesting that the Levetrage network itself can be
used to spread a story quickly. By raising the specter of a Levetrage-centered
negative publicity campaign, the prominence of the network increases and , the
network becomes more valuable. So there is incentive to coin holders all over the
world to spread the news and assist whenever a negative publicity campaign is
launched.

financially disincentivize any such attack. By simply hashing a future block, we
should be able convince any observer that the hash will be impossible to predict,

<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >  Each action will involve a Nash token, so will be tracked. Thus, a public record of all
outcomes will be available. Researchers will be able to predict and study the effectiveness
of different strategies, and this may lead to even more efficient procedures. Accordingly,
Levetrage service providers (oracles, publicists, law firms) can gain reputation by
developing a track record. Players new to the ecosystem will be easily able to
search all past events and outcomes and contact the providers that are best

fit.

<!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >  We hope that the Levetrage network will become a brand name, with first mover
recognition. While in theory, someone could write any of the same code into any
blockchain, their adversary may not know to take it seriously.

<!--l. 254--><p class="indent" >  We plan to provide the basic vehicles for commitments. However, it should be rather
easy for other blockchain users to develop layers on top of the platform that are more
creative or tailored to their unique situations that may arise. In any case, we won&#8217;t be
able to stop them.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3100012"></a>Other Use Cases</h3>
<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >The following use cases are more involved but maybe be possible if the network is more
developed.
<!--l. 259--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3200012.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Ad Hoc Consumer Organization.</span></span>
<!--l. 260--><p class="indent" >  Consumers with a common interest (say pricing gouging by a cable provider) can pool
payments in order to negotiate fair customer relations.
<!--l. 261--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3300012.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Ad Hoc Labor Organization.</span></span>
<!--l. 262--><p class="indent" >  In the gig economy, entire industries can form in short periods of time. Corporations
can devise agreements that would not be acceptable in traditional company-worker
relationships. Mixed strategy contracts that are activated when a certain number of users
sign up can force negotiation. This may require some yet-to-be developed enforcement
mechanisms.
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3400012.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Whistleblowing.</span></span>
<!--l. 264--><p class="indent" >  Employees may threaten (anonymously) to report (non-anonymously) practices that
the employee would like stopped. For example, in many states, the board regulating an
industry will not accept anonymous reports. Thus a credible threat can be made
anonymously. Remark: We are not lawyers, but have reason to believe that
if the activity is criminal in nature, it is not legally permitted to use this as
leverage.
<!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.4. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3500012.4"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Reputation Based Commitment.</span></span>
<!--l. 268--><p class="indent" >  This is a slightly different nature, as it involves repeated games. In many cases, a
committing maneuver maybe difficult to implement. However, if one has a reputation to
uphold, then failing to follow through results in forfeiting the reputation. The platform
could allow a business or individuals to make threats or promises (including probabilistic
ones), and then maintain a record of whether these were fulfilled (provided verifying such
this is easy to do.) This is similar to the idea of a credit score; Lenders believe you will
pay off your loan based on your history of repaying loans. Promises such as &#8220;If Trump
wins, I move to Canada&#8221; can then be used to malign credibility if not followed
through.

<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.5. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3600012.5"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Litigation Financing.</span></span>
<!--l. 270--><p class="indent" >  Pie-in-the-sky for now, but with minimal imagination, one can see that by combining
litigation threats as discussed above with crowd financing, some very interesting
scenarios arise. Many of the scenarios are desirable, although with a little imagination,
one can conjure up some that aren&#8217;t.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3700013"></a>Other Issues </h3>
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3800013.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Asymmetric Information and Belief.</span></span>
<!--l. 275--><p class="indent" >  Game theory is a very tough subject to obtain complete results in, especially when
applying these to the real world. This is particularly the case when players have differing
ideas and beliefs about the expectations surrounding their conflict. In this case, players
can make strong moves either out of desire to bluff or out of legitimate belief that they
are offering the best offer. The adversary has no way to determine if an offer is a
bluff or not. These sort of infinite horizon games with asymmetric information
are hard to predict. If the expectations are far apart, a Rubinstein game can
lead to a series of offers which will not be accepted. Nonetheless, it should be
possible that some of the tools may be used in a way that will expedite solution
reaching.
<!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >  &#x00A0;
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-3900013.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Repeated Games.</span></span>
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >  Some players always make an choice that is irrational in the near future, but is
motivated by the idea that they will face similar challenges in the future. In some
industries, pissing contests are normal. Certain entities may scare off challengers by
demonstrating that they are willing to accept losses in order to maintain a tough position
in the future. In such cases, there may be no rational move that player can
make.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14. </span> <a 
 id="x1-4000014"></a>Future Efforts and Needs</h3>
<!--l. 312--><p class="noindent" >This project is part coding and larger part network building and research.
<!--l. 313--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-4100014.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Legal consultation.</span></span>
<!--l. 314--><p class="indent" >  We would like to construct both smart contracts and templates for legal contracts that
are legally viable in most jurisdictions, and will not expose anyone to any harmful
litigation. This requires serious consultation with appropriate legal counsel. The main
resource required here is money. We don&#8217;t believe we are selling securities, or offering
gambling, but we would like to assure the network that we are on the right side of the
law.
<!--l. 315--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-4200014.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Network Building.</span></span>
<!--l. 316--><p class="indent" >  We will need to find partners and service providers to get the network started. This
will require time and effort by team members
<!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-4300014.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Development.</span></span>
<!--l. 318--><p class="indent" >  Obviously, this is also a critical component. To accelerate to process, we would need
hire dedicated developers. If enough funding is available, this could simply mean offering
team members enough to &#8220;quit their day job.&#8221;
