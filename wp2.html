<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >The bargaining problem is often given as follows <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XR82">Rub82</a>,&#x00A0;pg 97]</span>:
       <!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >    Two individuals have before them several possible contractual
       agreements. Both have interests in reaching agreement but their
       interests  are  not  entirely  identical.  What  &#8220;will  be&#8221;  the  agreed
       contract, assuming that both parties behave rationally?
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >This is a difficult problem. Without ways to enforce binding threats, negotiation can be
unpredictable, and often the outcome is determined by factors not easy to quantify
within the scope of classical economic discussions. Solutions to hard problems are by
nature evasive, so academics usually restrict themselves to tractable models. In 1953,
Nash <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNash53">Nas53</a>]</span> studied a model demand game, and gave axiomatic characterizations of
the so called Nash Bargaining Solution. Rubinstein&#8217;s seminal paper <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XR82">Rub82</a>]</span> in 1982
indicated a possible strategic approach towards inducing a solution. Rubinstein&#8217;s game
(developed further in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBRW86">BRW86</a>]</span>) introduced two factors forcing the players to resolve the
game: 1) A penalty for time spent negotiating and 2) exogenous probability of
negotiation breakdown.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  Game theoretical situations, in contrast to real world negotiations, usually allow
players to choose from a finite-parameter space of moves. In the real world, there are an
unlimited number of moves, and there are an unlimited number of games players can
choose to play. If one player has the ability to fully commit to a threat, this
player can change the nature of the game by limiting the rational options of his
opponent.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  We argue that the blockchain provides two important features that make a Rubinstein
solution practical. First, genuine, publicly observable randomness (cf. <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBCG">BCG15</a>]</span>).
Second, smart contracts that allow for sums of money to be directed around, based on
randomness or on the direction of neutral oracles. With smart contracts, it is now much
easier to credibly make threats.

<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  We refer the reader to T.C. Schelling&#8217;s classic text, <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>]</span> for a fascinating
discussion of how game theory meets the real world. A more modern reference on the
theoretical side is given in the monograph <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XMuthoo">Mut99</a>]</span>, which includes a thorough
discussion of Rubinstein type games.

<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >When two parties are negotiating over a surplus, there is a well-defined idea in game
theory literature of what the agreement &#8220;should&#8221; be. This is called the Nash Bargaining
Solution (NBS). Assuming that the NBS is the result of an efficient market,
any agreement reached other than the NBS should be considered a market
inefficiency.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >  We begin by stating our main result here, and then explain its components in the
sequel. This is essentially given by arguments in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>commitment devices</h3>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >Paraphrasing Schelling&#8217;s definition of commitment: <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSchelling1960">Sch60</a>]</span>[pg 127], we say that
commitment involves maneuvers that leave one in a position so that their only rational
option is follow through with a threat. The object of commitment is the credibility of a
threat. Nash nicely summarizes the issues involving threats as follows <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNash53">Nas53</a>,&#x00A0;pg
130]</span>:
       <!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >    If one considers the process of making a threat, one sees that its
       elements are as follows: A threatens B by convincing B that if B
       does not act in compliance with A&#8217;s demands, then A will follow
       a certain policy T. Suppose A and B to be rational beings, it is

       essential for the success of the threat that A be <span 
class="cmti-10">compelled </span>to carry
       out his threat T if B fails to comply. Otherwise it will have little
       meaning. For, in general, to execute the threat will not be something
       A would want to do, just of itself. The point of this discussion is
       that we must assume there is an adequate mechanism for forcing
       players to stick to their threats and demands once made: and one
       to enforce the bargain, once agreed. Thus we need a sort of umpire,
       who will enforce contracts of commitments.
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-40003.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Commitment Using the Blockchain.</span></span>
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >  Smart contracts on the blockchain can provide a simple mechanism for commitment,
by using an oracle. Suppose that <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>makes a threat. <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>can can always borrow a large
amount of money, and tie the funds up in a smart contract on the blockchain. If a
trusted oracle determines that the threat has not been followed through, the funds are
&#8220;burned&#8221;. So if two players are bargaining over $100, <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>can declare that he will lose $100
if he accepts less than $95. Now <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>has no rational choice but to agree to $95. We
assume that the oracle can only see the outcome of the final agreement, and
is not corruptible. (In practice, the perceived corruptibility is potentially an
issue.)
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-50003.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Commitment Release.</span></span>
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >  Taken at face value, the above commitment device leads to a &#8220;draw first&#8221; game.
However, we argue that if one can create a commitment, one should also be able to
create a way to release the other side from commitment. For example, if <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>ties up $100
in a contract, <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>can counter with a slightly more complex contract: <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>also ties up $100,
and loses his $100 if he makes any agreement, unless, $50 is deposited into
a third account that is directly controlled by <span 
class="cmmi-10">B</span>. Now <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>is released from his
commitment: He can create a contract that controls $50, sending it to the account
controlled by <span 
class="cmmi-10">B</span>, if and only if <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>agrees to the original 95/5 split. The oracle
governing <span 
class="cmmi-10">A</span>&#8217;s original contract can only see that an acceptable 95/5 split has
been agreed to, but cannot see that <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>is contemporaneously giving $50 back to
<span 
class="cmmi-10">B</span>.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >  It does not take much imagination to see, that with trustworthy but scope-limited
oracles, this game can can go on ad infinitum.

 id="x1-60003.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Advantages of the Blockchain for this type of commitment.</span></span>
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >  Implementing a legal contract accomplishing the above would be more problematic, we
imagine.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="wp22.html#fn1x0">1</a></span><a 
 id="x1-6001f1"></a>
The code that receives a broadcast signal and either refunds or distributes <span 
class="cmmi-10">A</span>&#8217;s money is
not a legal contract. It&#8217;s a piece of code, and does not require considerations from
multiple parties. Importantly, while a court can rule that a legal contract is not
enforceable, courts cannot rule code executable, nor can they reverse the execution of the
code once it is executed.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4. </span> <a 
 id="x1-70004"></a>Mixed Strategies</h3>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >If players are always able to make and release commitments as in the previous section,
the game is essentially the same as without these devices. What is needed, then, is a
threat to make the negotiations fail completely. Provided that a player has a mechanism
for causing the negotiation to fail, this player can turn a messy game into a much tidier
Rubinstein type game.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >  In particular, suppose that <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>knows that commencing irrevocable event <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>will cause
the negotiation to fail, to both players&#8217; detriment. <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>can make an offer on some block of
the blockchain, and then attach to it a probability <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span>. If, after so many blocks, the offer is
not accepted, then <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>happens with probability (1 <span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span>). Now <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>must not dilly-dally. If the
offer is acceptable, it should be accepted. It will not be accepted, only in the
situation that <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>believes that <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>can achieve a better outcome by continuing
negotiation.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >  At this point, we claim the game is almost symmetric: <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>could immediately make a
counter offer of the same nature, so provided <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>is near 1 there is little difference in who
goes first. Now <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>should not make <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>too low: <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>can always immediately return the same
offer the instant (or the next block) that <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>receives the offer. So little is gained by
making <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>too low. However, there is always a probability that <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>will not receive the the
threat. The only situation in which a low <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>would give advantage to <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>would be if <span 
class="cmmi-10">A</span>
catches <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>in a situation where <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>has the ability to immediately accept the offer
the instant it is offered, but not the ability to immediately return a counter
offer.
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-80004.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Proof of Theorem 1.</span></span>
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >  We prove our theorem by arguing that <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>should be very close to 1 and the offer should
be the Nash Bargaining Solution. (Recall that in the simplest symmetric case, the NBS
simply splits the pot). We argue by contradiction: First we suppose that there is a
strategy for <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>that has an expectation of larger than 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>2. <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>makes the offer determined
by this strategy. Now the instant that the offer is received, by symmetry, <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>believes they
can maximize their expectations going forward by making the same counter offer. Since
this move by <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>(who is assumed rational) is determined, the expectation to <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>is still the
expectation that remains. But <span 
class="cmmi-10">B</span>&#8217;s expectation is at least that of <span 
class="cmmi-10">A</span>&#8217;s, so both are larger
than 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>2, a contradiction. So 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>2 is an upper bound for expectations to <span 
class="cmmi-10">A</span>. Thus, if <span 
class="cmmi-10">A</span>
can achieve 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>2 via strategy <span 
class="cmmi-10">S</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>should implement <span 
class="cmmi-10">S</span>. One such strategy is
to begin by offering 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>2. <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>also knows that the best <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>can hope for is 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x2215;</span>2,
so <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>will accept it if offered. So <span 
class="cmmi-10">A </span>should make an offer, but attach with it
some probability <span 
class="cmmi-10">p &#x003C; </span>1. By choosing <span 
class="cmmi-10">p </span>slightly less than 1, <span 
class="cmmi-10">B </span>should accept as
soon as possible, so as to minimize the probability that the game will end in
failure.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5. </span> <a 
 id="x1-90005"></a>Disagreement Device</h3>
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >In order to implement the game described in the previous section, we needed a credible
disagreement device. In the literature, this problem is nontrivial: For example, we quote
from a 2011 discussion of Rubinstein&#8217;s game <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBA2011">AB11</a>]</span>:
       <!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >    The  presence  of  Nature&#8217;s  choice  in  that  procedure  is  very
       appealing. It points out the possibility that a relationship may end
       after a failure to reach an agreement with some probability. But

       the fact that this probability is determined by one of the players
       may not be deemed very realistic.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >  With the randomness present in the blockchain, the probability can be determined by
one of the players realistically. What is left is for us to show is that the blockchain can
trigger a disagreement event. This means the contract should take an action that the
player who created the contract cannot take back, and should be damaging to the other
party.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >  We suggest a very simple form of such a device: The contract takes funds that
previously belonged to a player, and deposits these into an account held by a third party.
The third party has invoiced the player for services to be delivered as soon as funds are
transfered. The player and the third party have signed an agreement making any
payments non-refundable.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >  While there are a number a services that can legally be contracted for, we suggest one
in particular: negative publicity.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >  For example, a player may make an arrangement with a PR firm for $2500
worth of negative publicity against his negotiating adversary. The PR agrees
to perform this, pending a non-refundable payment. In many legal disputes,
one litigant may have damning information on the adversary that will cause
more damage to the adversary than the cost of spreading it. This works in
particular if the litigant has a clear legal right to speak loudly and freely.
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="wp23.html#fn2x0">2</a></span><a 
 id="x1-9001f2"></a> This
can even be further automated: A freeway billboard company or internet advertising
agency can sell negative advertising, and publish the advertising the instant the payment
is received.
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" ><span class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-100005.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Example.</span></span>
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >  Suppose a customer is sold a defective product, and the seller refuses to refund the
product. The customer can threaten to spend several hundred dollars with a marketing
firm publicizing just how horrible the defective product was. If the business
stands to lose more in future sales than the cost of the marketing, the business is
wise to offer the customer a refund, up to an amount determined by Theorem
<a 
href="#x1-2001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: Levetrage --></a>.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6. </span> <a 
 id="x1-110006"></a>Randomness on the blockchain</h3>
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >Publicly observable randomness is an interesting open problem. Due to the
decentralized nature of blockchains, future blocks are extremely hard to predict,
and we think, the uncertainty is enough for the success of a mixed strategy.
The question of whether the hash of a future block can be manipulated has
been studied in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBCG">BCG15</a>]</span> and <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XPW16">PW16</a>]</span> where it is shown that some small
influence may be bought for a very high price, but this must be done by bribing
some portion of the mining pool. We feel such an attack would be extremely
impractical. When designing a contract, it should be easy to require enough
randomness to financially disincentivize any such attack. By simply hashing a
future block, we should be able convince any observer that the hash will be
impossible to predict, at least enough to create the effect of mixed strategies.
Another option is to use an oracle that hashes an externally generated (and
generally trusted) beacon such as NIST Randomness Beacon <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNIST">NIS11</a>]</span>. Again, the

only real objective is to refer to a beacon that any adversary will believe is
unmalleable.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7. </span> <a 
 id="x1-120007"></a>Concept Summary</h3>
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >The typical use case is as follows. An individual finds herself in a dispute initiated by
another party, who is somewhat of a bully. Both parties have much to lose if the dispute
escalates, however, the adversary might have more to lose, in particular because the
adversary is in the wrong. Unfortunately for the individual, escalating the dispute comes
with costs, so she is averse to that. The bully knows this, and uses this fact against her,
continuing to extract concessions, and ignoring all threats. So instead of making a
vacuous threat, our protagonist makes a probabilistic threat to expose the bully far and
wide, and follows through with the threat, <span 
class="cmti-10">probabilistically</span>. The first act of commitment
is to simply let the random contract be executed. By doing this once, she has
demonstrated that she can stomach the low probability of a bad outcome, knowing
that the bully has considerably more exposure. When she makes the threat
again, the bully can no longer rely on her self-interest and must think about
his own. If the bully is rational, he will agree to end the dispute on equitable
terms.
